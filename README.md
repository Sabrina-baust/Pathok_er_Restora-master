# Pathok_er_Restora
- Before trying to run this project please ensure that you have the following apps installed:

1. nodejs
2. mongo db

- So, now that you have ensured installation of the above apps, don't forget to configure mongodb if not already configured. Google a bit to configure mongodb.
- Now what the problem is, this project depends on many npm modules. But Github won't allow to uploads those modules as it would cost a lot of space.
- So, now you have to intall those modules. To do that hit ***npm install*** and boom! You have installed all the packages(May require some time depending upon your internet speed).
- Now, open your terminal.
- Hit ***sudo mongod*** then give your password
- Open another tab in terminal and hit ***nodemon***
- Open your browser.
- Enter URL ***localhost:3000***
